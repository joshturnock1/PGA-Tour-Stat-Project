# PGA-Tour-Stat-Project


## Project Overview

I am an avid golfer, playing D1 College golf. 
I have always had many questions regarding which statistics lead to better results or more money earned on the PGA Tour.
This is why I have conducted this analysis from a dataset with different metrics of players on the PGA Tour from 2010-2018.

### Data Sources

### Tools
